Andrew Willette, Justin Gorecki, and Arjun Viswanathan were the team members for this programming assignment. We met up and coded together for many hours together over a couple of weeks to complete this project. The work was divided as follows:
Andrew: Encryption and decryption using AES, HMAC implementation, key-generation.
Justin: Menu functions, PRNG, HMAC, file manipulation with encryption and decryption.
Arjun: Setting up program structure and main, hashing of master password, menu functions.
